Hi Instructor,
For the first task if somehow code fails to operate kindle increment the parameters of haarcascade_frontal_default.
I have checked my code with plenty of images but if somehow images are too complex to detect please change the parameter.

For the task 2 if somehow you are getting error of reshape please change the parameter of haarcascade_frontal_default 
and if you are getting wrong cluster please increase the rseed value while passing to to def clustering. I have checked
my code with many datasets but still if images are too complex please change the rseed values.

Summary:
Task1: facecascade parameter change (+=0.1,+-1) 

Task2: facecascade parameter change (+=0.1,+-1) 
and
clustering(X,kk,kk+n)
where n= 4,5,6.......


Thanks,
for any query contact
